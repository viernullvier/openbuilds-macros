## Additional features

- Persist and load last used values
- New "Direction" option:
  - `both` (default behavior in the upstream repo): Alternate between climb and conventional cutting; ideal for lasers.
  - `single`: Only cut in one direction, move to safe z-height and back to origin between cuts.
