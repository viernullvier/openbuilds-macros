Collection of JS macros for OpenBuilds CONTROL

## Macros

See individual `README.md` files in each macro folder.

## Installing

**Automatic:** In OpenBuilds CONTROL, choose `Import JSON Macro` and select `$MACRO.json` in the specific subfolder.

**Manual:** In OpenBuilds CONTROL, choose `Create New Macro`, select `Javascript` and paste the content of the macro subfolder's `index.js` into the text area. *Note:* You probably need to select `Run Macro on startup` for most of the macros to work - see the macro's `README.md` file.
